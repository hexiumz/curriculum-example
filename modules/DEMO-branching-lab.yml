        Now it is your turn to walk through the GitHub Workflow. Start by creating a branch and adding a new file to your repository.

        On the left side of the nav bar above, there is a link called `Repository`. If you click on it, you'll be brought to a GitHub repo that we created for you. From there, you can follow the instructions below. We'll validate certain steps as you go so you know you're doing it right.
      steps:
        - description: "Click on the `Repository` link."
          id: DEMO-branches-lab-repo
        - description: "Look around. This is the Code Veiw, where all your code in the repo is stored."
          id: DEMO-branches-lab-look
        - description: "In the upper left, click on the drop down next to `Branch: master`. This is where you can create new branches, or switch to another branch."
          id: DEMO-branches-lab-branch-button        
        - description: "Create a branch called `create-bio`."
          id: DEMO-branches-lab-create-branch
          verifications:
            - verification-type: branch-created
              id: DEMO-branches-lab-create-branch-verification
              success-message: "Great job - you created a branch."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't created a branch yet."
        - description: |
            On the `create-bio` branch, create a file called `new-file.md`. Include the following text:
            
            ```
            This is a new file.
            * It is formatted using markdown.
            * That's why it has the `.md` file extension.
            ```

          verifications:
            - verification-type: file-created
              id: DEMO-branches-lab-create-branch-verification
              success-message: "Great job - you committed the change."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't committed the change yet."
        - description: |
            Add a commit message and commit the file directly to your branch.
