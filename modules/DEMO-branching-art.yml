        ## Branches

        In GitHub, a branch is a working copy of your project. Everything in your project lives on a branch.

        By convention, the default branch is a repository is called `master`. Master is typically the deployed, production copy of your code. When you are ready to make changes or add a new feature to your project, you will create a new branch to avoid introducing bugs in your production code. At the end of the GitHub workflow, this branch will be merged back into `master`.

        When you create a branch, you are creating a full copy of the parent branch and giving it a new, unique name. From that point on edits made to one branch _will not_ show up on the parent until you merge the branches back together.

        ### Using Branches Effectively

        It is common to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given timeâ€”some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

        Any time you want to start a new chunk of work, you should create a new branch for that work.

        Each branch you create should exist to introduce a single feature or fix a single bug. You want to create short-lived, single-purpose branches that can easily be merged (or reverted) later.

        Here is a video walk-through of how to create a branch on GitHub:

        ##Commiting

        Committing is how you take a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time. Commits are added to the current branch and can include changes to one or more files.

        Commits always have a brief message associated with them. The commit message is a description of the changes introduced in this snapshot. Think of it as the story of your project, 50 characters at a time. 

        Here's a short video on creating, editing, and commiting files on GitHub:
